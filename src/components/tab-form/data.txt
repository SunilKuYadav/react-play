ðŸ”¹ Questions to Ask the Interviewer
	1.	Form Structure
	â€¢	What fields should be in each tab? (e.g., Profile â†’ name, email, Interest â†’ hobbies, Settings â†’ password, notifications).
	â€¢	Are the fields fixed or should the solution be extendable?
	2.	Validation Rules
	â€¢	What kind of validation is required? (required fields, email format, password length, etc.).
	â€¢	Should validation happen on blur, on tab switch, or only on submit?
	3.	Form Submission
	â€¢	Should the entire form data (all tabs) be submitted at once from the Settings tab?
	â€¢	What happens after submission â€” API call, console log, or just success message?
	4.	Tab Navigation
	â€¢	Can users switch freely between tabs, or should validation block moving to the next tab?
	â€¢	Do we need to persist the data when switching tabs?
	5.	Tech Details
	â€¢	Do I need to use a specific library like Formik / React Hook Form or only plain React?
	â€¢	Should I use controlled inputs (state-based) or uncontrolled with refs?
