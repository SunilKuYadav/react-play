Nice — let’s design a production-ready CDN. I’ll give you a complete, practical architecture, the major components, data flows, operational concerns, and concrete examples (cache key rules, sample Nginx edge config, signed-URL HMAC, invalidation API sketch, metrics & SLOs). I’ll also call out trade-offs and optional advanced features (edge compute, image transforms, streaming). Ready? Here we go.

1 — High-level goals
	•	Serve static and dynamic content with low latency worldwide.
	•	High availability and fault tolerance.
	•	Good cache hit ratio → low origin cost & fast responses.
	•	Secure delivery (TLS, WAF, signed URLs).
	•	Flexible cache invalidation and origin control.
	•	Observability, autoscaling, and cost predictability.

2 — Major components
	1.	Origin(s)
	•	Primary content storage (S3, GCS, self-hosted origin servers, or application backends).
	•	Optional origin shield (regional cache fronting origin) to reduce origin load.
	2.	Edge POPs (Points of Presence)
	•	Many geographically distributed edge nodes that cache and serve content.
	•	Each POP runs an HTTP reverse-proxy (Nginx/Envoy/Caddy) plus optional edge functions runtime (V8/Wasmtime).
	3.	Global Routing / Anycast
	•	Anycast IPs so users go to nearest POP via BGP.
	•	DNS-based fallback if Anycast not available.
	4.	Control plane
	•	API to manage configuration: cache rules, routes, certs, purge/invalidate, origin lists.
	5.	Management plane
	•	UI + API for analytics, logs, billing.
	6.	WAF / DDoS protection
	•	WAF rules, rate limiting, IP reputation lists, bot mitigation.
	7.	Monitoring & Logging
	•	Metrics (latency, hit/miss ratio, bandwidth), real-time logs, traces.
	8.	Certificate manager
	•	Automated TLS (ACME/Let’s Encrypt) + wildcard certs + custom cert uploads.
	9.	Security tokens / Signed URLs
	•	For private content (HMAC tokens, short-lived URLs).
	10.	Edge compute (optional)
	•	For dynamic logic: A/B tests, image resizing, authentication, responses assembled at edge.

3 — Traffic / Request flow (simple)
	1.	Client requests https://cdn.example.com/image.jpg.
	2.	DNS resolves to Anycast IP → routes to nearest POP.
	3.	POP checks local cache:
	•	HIT → serve cached object directly (with proper headers).
	•	MISS → POP checks origin shield or requests origin.
	4.	Origin returns object + caching headers → POP caches and serves.
	5.	Logs & metrics emitted (access logs, cache status).

4 — Cache key & caching strategy

A well-designed cache key maximizes reuse and avoids accidental misses.

Cache key composition (recommended):
	•	Protocol (http/https) — optional if same cert.
	•	Host header (support multi-tenant).
	•	Path (normalized): remove duplicate slashes, percent-decode where safe.
	•	Query parameters: either include all or canonicalize / whitelist. For many assets exclude query if versioned in path, or sort & include only allowed params (?w=400&h=200 for image transforms).
	•	Relevant headers: Accept-Encoding (gzip, br), Accept (image/webp fallback), User-Agent only when necessary (very rare). Prefer Vary headers instead.
	•	Cookie: Usually strip cookies for static assets.

Examples:
	•	Static assets: cache_key = host + path (ignore query).
	•	Image transforms: cache_key = host + path + canonicalized_query(w,h,fit,fmt).

Cache TTL rules:
	•	Immutable assets (content hashed in filename): TTL = very long (365d), Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable.
	•	Versioned assets (file@v123.js): long TTL.
	•	HTML pages: short TTL (10–60s) or use stale-while-revalidate.
	•	API responses: orchestrate via Cache-Control + Surrogate-Control (edge-only) headers.

Stale policies:
	•	stale-while-revalidate — serve stale while fetching fresh in background.
	•	stale-if-error — serve stale on origin error.

5 — Invalidation & Purging

Two models:
	1.	Invalidate by path/pattern (fast, common) — API: POST /invalidate with list of paths or wildcards.
	2.	Tag-based invalidation — object written with tag; invalidate tag => all objects with tag expire.
	3.	Cache-Control revalidation — short TTL + origin validation (If-Modified-Since/ETag).

Example pseudo-API:

POST /v1/invalidate
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "paths": ["/assets/app.js", "/images/*/thumb*"],
  "purgeMode": "soft"  // "soft" marks as stale, "hard" removes
}

6 — Security
	•	Always terminate TLS at edge POPs. Use modern TLS versions and cipher suites.
	•	Support HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 (QUIC) on edges.
	•	WAF rules to block SQLi/XSS patterns and suspicious user agents.
	•	Rate limiting per IP and per route.
	•	Signed URLs for private content: HMAC of path + expiry + optional IP restriction.
	•	Validate origin HTTPS; use origin certificate verification (mutual TLS optional).

Signed URL HMAC example (Node-style pseudo):

// secret key is known to CDN control-plane & signing tool
const hmac = HMAC_SHA256(secret, `${path}|${expiry}|${clientIp||''}`);
const token = base64url(`${expiry}:${hmac}`);
URL = `${host}${path}?_cdntoken=${token}`;

Edge checks _cdntoken validity and expiry.

7 — Edge server example (Nginx-like) for caching

(Edge node that caches from origin, honors Cache-Control, strips cookies for static assets)

server {
  listen 443 ssl http2;
  server_name cdn.example.com;

  ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/cdn.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/cdn.key;

  proxy_cache_path /var/cache/nginx levels=1:2 keys_zone=cdn_cache:100m max_size=50g inactive=60d use_temp_path=off;

  location ~* \.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|webp|svg|css|js|woff2?)$ {
    proxy_cache cdn_cache;
    proxy_cache_key "$scheme$host$uri";
    proxy_cache_valid 200 302 30d;
    proxy_cache_valid 404 1m;
    proxy_cache_use_stale error timeout updating http_500 http_502 http_503 http_504;
    proxy_ignore_headers Set-Cookie;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_pass https://origin.example.com;
  }

  # HTML: short cache + revalidate
  location / {
    proxy_cache cdn_cache;
    proxy_cache_key "$scheme$host$uri?$args";
    proxy_cache_valid 200 10s;
    proxy_cache_use_stale updating;
    add_header Cache-Status $upstream_cache_status;
    proxy_pass https://origin.example.com;
  }
}

8 — Origin shielding
	•	Designate one regional POP as a shield for a region (e.g., EU shield in Frankfurt). Other POPs in region forward misses to shield → reduces origin load and thundering herd.

9 — Global routing & failover
	•	Anycast + BGP for global routing to nearest POP.
	•	Geo-DNS as fallback (DNS-based load balancing by region).
	•	POP health checks: if POP unhealthy, withdraw routes (BGP) or return 503 so DNS can route elsewhere.

10 — Edge compute (optional)
	•	Use wasm or JS runtime for:
	•	Image transforms on the fly.
	•	Custom authentication (JWT verification).
	•	A/B tests, header rewrites.
	•	HTML personalization.
	•	Keep runtime cold-start minimal; limit CPU & memory per request.

11 — Streaming & large files
	•	Support range requests for video and large downloads.
	•	Use chunked transfer encoding and accelerate via HTTP/2/3 multiplexing.
	•	For live streaming: WebRTC or HLS/DASH segments served from POPs; origin uses streaming packager.

12 — Observability & SLOs

Key metrics
	•	Latency (p50/p95/p99)
	•	Cache hit ratio (global / per-region / per-path)
	•	Bandwidth served from edge vs origin
	•	Origin requests per second
	•	4xx/5xx rates (edge and origin)
	•	Purge/invalidation latency
	•	TLS handshake times

SLO examples
	•	99.95% availability for POPs regionally.
	•	Cache hit ratio > 85% for static assets.
	•	Purge propagation < 5 seconds (soft invalidation) or < 60s (global hard).

Logging
	•	Real-time access logs (JSON) to centralized storage (Kafka → ELK/ClickHouse).
	•	Trace request through POP → shield → origin (correlation IDs).

13 — Cost model / Capacity planning
	•	Cost drivers: bandwidth out (largest), POP infra (instances & network), origin egress, storage for cache (if charged), control-plane operations.
	•	Autoscale edges by network usage; use smaller instances for POP control, large bandwidth NICs for data plane.
	•	Consider spot instances for some POPs to lower cost, but ensure redundancy.

14 — Deployment / CI
	•	Infrastructure as Code: Terraform for POPs, BGP config, routes, DNS.
	•	Blue/green for control plane & POP software.
	•	Canary deploy edge-function changes to a subset of POPs.
	•	Automated TLS provisioning in pipeline (ACME clients with rate limits handled).

15 — Example advanced features (value adds)
	•	Image optimization (auto WebP/AVIF fallback).
	•	Edge A/B testing & experimentation.
	•	Regional pricing / geo-blocking.
	•	Origin shield and cache-warming for major releases.
	•	Tiered caching: local edge → regional cache → origin.

16 — Trade-offs & design decisions
	•	Anycast vs Geo-DNS: Anycast gives lower latency but is operationally complex and requires BGP expertise. Geo-DNS is simpler.
	•	Strong consistency vs performance: aggressive caching + stale-while-revalidate favors availability and performance over immediate consistency. Use short TTLs or purge for strong consistency needs.
	•	Edge compute: powerful but increases attack surface and cost. Only run minimal trusted code.
	•	Cache invalidation: immediate hard purge is costly; prefer versioned URLs where possible.

17 — Minimal PoC tech stack (fast build)
	•	Edge reverse proxy: Nginx or Envoy
	•	Caching: built-in proxy cache (Nginx) or Varnish for sophisticated rules
	•	Origin storage: S3 + CloudFront-like origin behaviors (or self-hosted with nginx)
	•	Anycast provider: AWS Global Accelerator / Cloud provider with Anycast (or leverage cloud POPs)
	•	Control plane: Node.js/Express + Postgres for config
	•	Logs/metrics: Fluentd → ClickHouse/Elastic + Grafana
	•	WAF: ModSecurity at edge or cloud WAF

18 — Example: Simple signed URL verification pseudo-code (edge)

// at edge before serving object
function verifySignedUrl(path, token, secret) {
  const [expiry, sig] = token.split(':');
  if (Date.now()/1000 > Number(expiry)) return false;
  const expected = base64url(hmac_sha256(secret, `${path}|${expiry}`));
  return constantTimeEqual(expected, sig);
}

If you want, I can:
	•	produce a concrete Terraform + Nginx PoC (files & configs),
	•	write the signed-URL implementation in Node/Go, or
	•	sketch sequence diagrams / monitoring dashboards and alert rules.

Which of those should I build next for you?
